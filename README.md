# YO YO YO
this is a markdown file, called the README which you see on the front page of your git repo.
this file is what everyone sees, so it should contain useful and relevant info, such as
changelogs, todo lists, etc.

Here's a [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for your benefit,
trust me it'll help when making the README and any other markdown files. Markdown is pretty powerful.

## Language
* python 3.8.5

## Project Idea
* TBD

## I Wanted To
introduce myself in this readme since:

* everyone will see it
* i know things (probably)
* i dont have a life

Anyway, I work part time writing scripts (in python) for monitoring AWS cloud servers and storage, and some other stuff.
I won't call myself an expert, because that's a stretch, but I like to think I know python pretty well (I'd hope so since I use it for a living).
Also because of my work, I'm fairly familiar with git and version control, so I kinda know what I'm doing there too. So now that I've hyped myself
up way too much, I just wanted to say feel free to ask me any questions if you're not sure about something, and I'll at least try to help work it out.
