## Getting Started
Install the newest version of Python (3.9.0) if you don't already have it, and git or
GitHub desktop. To install the package requirements just navigate to the project folder
in **powershell or git bash**, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can run `pip -V` or `python -V` to test your python install. When installing
python make sure to check the box 'Add Python to the PATH'
